      <div class="twotoone">
        <div class="textpart">
          <p>Towards the end of my Spring quarter of my Junior year at UCSD I was reached out by my now, amazing supervisor-head of the UX team of the Campus Mobile Team for the UCSD ITS Department. I have since been working as a student worker as a UX/UI Designer and it has been absolutely wonderful!
          <br>
          <br>
          Two months into this new job and my co-worker, Kenny, and I were eager to pick up some new projects. Jeremy shared with us some projects he was currently working on, one of which was a marketing strategy with the school for the UCSD mobile app. With the Fall quarter coming up soon, a big goal
          of the Campus Mobile Team was to have more new and current students download the app to help them have a better experience here at UCSD.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="imgpart">
          <img src="ucsdlogo.png" alt="" style="width:250px; height:auto;">
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="overview">
        <p>With that in mind, I put myself in the shoes of a new prospective student downloading the app for the first time. Putting myself in this persona made me realize how bland our current login/onboarding page is.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>I suggested that we should redesign the splash screen and login/onboarding pages</strong> in hopes to achieve the overall goal and my supervisor thought it was a great idea! For the next two weeks, Kenny (my co-worker) and
          I embarked on this journey to a fresh new onboarding/login experience.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-left:50px;">Timeline</h2>

        <div class="imgpart">
          <img src="tl.png" alt="" style="height:200px; width:auto;">
        </div>
        <div class="textpart">
          <p>After our supervisor introduced this project, we first wanted to define our goals before brainstorming on ways to redesign. After defining our goals we would then brainstorm and do some secondary research.
            After researching we would redesign, gather feedback, iterate and repeat this product until we get to our satisfied final redesign. Once we reach that point we would send it off to the developers of the team and
            have them implement it and get it ready to launch!</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          - Encourage more downloads of the UCSD Mobile App
          <br>
          - Create a more compelling first launch/onboarding experience
          <br>
          - Boost the login rate of students, staff and faculty

        <div class="currenttext">

            <br>
            <i>Both Kenny and I concluded that it is a bit dull and doesn’t help sell our app and meet the goals we have defined.</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            The two options: “Let’s do it” and “Skip for now” is user friendly in which it allows flexibility for users to enter the app without
            loging in but tying in our business goals with design, we want to boost the login rate of students, staff and faculty so we decided that needs to change.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the user clicks on “Let’s do it” they are taken to the login page (Figure 2) which upon logging they will be brought to the home page.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overview">
        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>After defining our goals and pinpointing some of the pain points, we conducted secondary research on not only on other higher education apps
          but also any other apps that had a good onboarding experience. We identified and analyzed other apps to identify features and design ideas that should be considered for inclusion in the UCSD Mobile App. </p>

          <p>After researching over 25 different apps, both higher education apps and other general apps, we found reoccuring designs that may be useful to our redesign.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><i>In order for us to create a more compelling onboarding/login experience that also meets our strategic goals, we decided to add in a splash screen animation,
            extend the onboarding experience, and allow users to select their experience.</i></strong> </p>

          <p>Kenny and I worked on the first iteration of redesigns for about a week and then presented them to the rest of the team, where we were able to get some thoughts and feedback on.
            It was nice to have this middle point because the developers gave us good feedback on what is feasible to implement in the short amount of time we had. In preparation for fall quarter,
            we wanted to get something out of the door that was good enough but still a step up from our current design. With that we set off to refine our design into what our final redesign looks like now.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="textpart">
          <p>On the left (Figure 5) you can see the splash screen animation we came up with. We wanted to stay true to the UCSD app branding and incorporated the logo into the splash screen.
            <br>
            <br>
            The onboarding experience is completely revamped as we added more screens to showcase some of the features that give users that personalized experience. (Figures 2-4)
            <br>
            <br>
            Users will then be able to select their experience. (Figure 6-8) Depending on which experience they choose, they will be prompted to login accordingly.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was both a design and business strategic choice. Having users select their experience in according to their role affiliated with UCSD will ensure students, staff, and faculty to log in. Which will help to meet our goal of boosting log in rates. </p>

      <div class="overview">
        <p>With this user flow, we have already tackled down all our main goals. But another smaller goal was that we wanted to increase the visibility of login. When visitors use this app they will not be asked to login.
          They will be taken straight to the home page and use the app normally without any personalized experiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          When designing this new onboarding experience, we eliminated the original “Skip for now” option that was there before in hopes to encourage more students, staff and faculty to log in. But with all design choices,
          there is still some flexibility to bypass that.
          <br>
          <br>
          We decided to add a persistent and non-persistent login banner in the vistor experience just as a reminder that logging in can be beneficial. (Figures 9-10) This design choice is to tackle the fact that students, staff, and faculty may still “unintentionally-intentionally” skip the login experience but give them the chance to log in once again. And of course, for the true visitor experience, users have the option to “x” and close the banner on the home page so that it will not hinder their experience in any way. (Figure 11)

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>That concludes this redesign project! It was a great learning experience to combine both design practices as well as business thinking into this redesign.
          This new login/onboarding experience is set to launch sometime before or in the Fall 2020 quarter. I am excited and eager to see the response we will get. With the launch,
          I hope to get feedback on it as well as real data results on whether it helped to achieve our goal for boosting downloads and logins. With those results,
          I would like to iterate and improve on these redesigns because features and designs can always be improved! </p>
