        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Grubhub is an app for food delivery or takeout. This app has integrated a neat service for faster campus dining.
        As a student at UCSD, I use the Grubhub app quite often to order ahead from campus dining halls to pick up and be able to eat at my apartment.
        But it is not the easiest feature to find and understand in the first place. I, along with my three other teammates from our DSGN1 class picked
        the Grubhub app as our product to observe for our project.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="dataintro">
        <div class="datacollection">
          <h2>Data Collection</h2>
          <p>My teammates and I all conducted our own set of interviews of undergraduate students at UCSD in front of dining halls, common space areas at student dorms and Geisel Library.
            We also interviewed in front of both eat-in (The Bistro) and regular dining halls (Pines, etc.) to see if problems with the app differed among the different types of service. As we asked our questions,
            we also took videos and/or screen recordings if the interviewees gave us consent. This allows us to see step-by-step their process which can vary between different users and we can draw conclusions based off of these observations. </p>

      <div class="overview">
        <h2>Identify Errors/Classify Errors</h2>
        <p>After interviewing a variety of students who used GrubHub,
          we identified three main errors that we most commonly observed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="errorgrid">
        <div class="e1">
          <img src="e1.gif" alt="" style="height:490px;width:auto;">
          <p style="text-align:center;">Error 1 - Time Intensive</p>
        </div>

        <div class="e2">
          <img src="e2.gif" alt="" style="height:490px;width:auto;">
          <p style="text-align:center;">Error 2 - Scrolling Past Items</p>
        </div>

        <div class="e3">
          <img src="e3.gif" alt="" style="height:490px;width:auto;">
          <p style="text-align:center;">Error 3 - Wrong Payment</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="overview">
        <div class="er1">
          <p>The first occurs whenever the user attempts to link their GrubHub to their campus dining/UCSD account.
            Many people have a tough time finding where the app settings are in order to connect their campus dining.
            In order to connect to campus dining, the user must navigate to “My GrubHub,” which is located at the bottom of their screen,
            and then click on the settings icon in the “My GrubHub” screen, then “Campus Dining.” (See Error 1). A lot of users spend a long
            time trying to find the “Campus Dining” option and open many menus and tabs in order to find it. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="er2">
          <p>The second error we observed happens when the user attempts to select a restaurant to dine from or a menu item to order.
            They often scroll past the item or restaurant they were looking for.  Scrolling is an action that we are all too familiar with,
            and sometimes it just becomes second-nature or instinct to keep scrolling. (See Error 2).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="er3">
          <p>The third error we identified occurs in the checkout screen of the GrubHub app. Sometimes users accidentally order with their credit
            or debit card instead of their campus dining dollars. This is because they accidentally forget to change their payment method when checking out.
            Most people do not often check whether their payment method is correct because we assume that their dining dollars card is always set as the default.
            Instead of performing the action they wished to, they performed an action they were most accustomed to. (See Error 3).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <div class="designspace">
        <div class="dsexplanation">
          <h2>Data Collection</h2>
          <p>For our design space we decided to look at the trade-off between the navigability and scroll space of the different apps’ menus.
            Navigability in our terms referred to the ease in which a customer could find an item, which was increased with photos or categorized menus.
            Scroll space referred to how much a user would have to scroll through to get to the bottom of the menu. In order to have similar menus to compare, we looked at Mexican build-your-own style menus. </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overview">
        <p>For postmates we looked at Chipotle (Figure DS.1), and saw that the postmates menu let users put photos
          of every item and had all the items in a long list separated by categories. This was navigable in the way that the
          photos were very helpful in quickly finding the item, but there was still a lot of scroll space.
          <br>
          <br>
          For Grubhub we saw text and a very compressed menu, which had low navigability and a medial amount of scroll space (Figure DS.2).
          <br>
          <br>
          With Doordash we again looked at Chipotle (Figure DS.3), and saw that the top menu had a few “featured items'' for convenience pictured at the top.
          The rest of the menu was compressed in the bottom. This had very little scroll space, but finding items other than the featured ones was difficult.
          <br>
          <br>
          For UberEats we looked at Rubios and there were no photos but only spaced out text (Figure DS.4). This was a lot of scroll space and not a lot of navigability,
          and it took a long time to find a certain type of bowl. This put UberEats in the bottom left with low navigability and lots of scroll space, adesign that may cause many capture slips.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our redesign has both navigability and less scroll space, close to ideal. It would have images and drop down menus based on categories of the menu, in order to reduce clutter of the initial menu and make items more identifiable to customers.

      <div class="overview">
        <h2>Redesign</h2>
        <p>After conducting our interviews, a common error we noticed is that there is confusion about where students can link their Campus Card into Grubhub to be able to order from on campus dining halls.
          In this redesign, to minimize error, we decided to add a campus logo at the top right corner of the landing page so users will not have to look for it so intensely.
          The logo affords clicking and it being a school logo signifies that it has to do with a college or campus (Figure RD 1.1). The school logo helps bridge the gulf of evaluation utilizing a system image that tells the user
          “hey click me! You can link your campus card here!”. After the user clicks on the logo, they can proceed with linking their campus card (Figure RD1.2).</p>

        </div>

        <div class="rd2text">
          <p>Through observation we noticed that some users would accidentally scroll past the dining hall they were looking for or the food item they were trying to order. We can attest to this because we asked the interviewees to say their thought process out loud.
            For example, one interviewee was saying they were going to order from Pines and just scrolled right past it and scrolled up and down a couple times before finding it and clicking it. Scrolling is such an autonomous action that it is easy for us to make this error.
            To reduce this error, our redesign focuses on a horizontal scroll instead of a vertical scroll (RD 2). Now the logo and name of the dining hall is big and centered making it hard for users to make an error in scrolling past what they want. The shadow behind each
            “box” signifies each individual dining hall. Being able to slightly see the next “box” also affords that you can scroll horizontally to view the next dining hall.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container2">
        <div class="rd3text">
          <p>From our interviews, some users expressed their frustrations for accidentally paying with their credit card instead of dining dollars because they forgot to change it back after ordering off-campus. Sometimes the checkout process can be tedious so users click through
            it quickly with the assumption that all their settings are correct. To eliminate this error, in our redesign we decided to add an extra step to ask the user for their payment method (RD 3). The logos for “credit card” and “campus card” help bridge the gulf of execution
            by utilizing appropriate system images that help describe what they are. After selecting the payment method, there is one last chance to review the entire order to make sure everything is actually correct. After clicking “place your order” an extra frame is added to help
            bridge the gulf of evaluation. Getting the green “order placed!” page is feedback to the users that their order has been successfully placed! Green color affords “success”.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center;">RD 3 - Payment/Checkout</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overview">
        <h2 style="margin-left:70px;">Next Steps</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:70px;">If I were given more time and resources I would expand my user research to other schools, not just UCSD students. More data means more analysis! And I would like to do some user testing on these redesigns to see if they make a meaningful impact to attack some of the errors we have identified.
          This project was fun and I’m glad to have had a great team to share the responsibilities with!</p>
