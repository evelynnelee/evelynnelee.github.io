          <div class="overview">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Weverse was created as an official community for fans to have a fresh, new, different,
              and more interpersonal way to connect with BTS and other artists. But ever since the release on July 1, 2019 ,
              I along with many other fans have voiced complaints of some of the user experience and interactions within the app.
              <br>
              <br>
              I propose to create a fresh new look for the app to adjust to the public’s complaints and dissatisfactions. I spent
              my winter break doing a redesign on the app. The main focus was to group things in a way that makes it straightforward
              and easy to find; as well as making certain sections less confusing and less cluttered so that it may be more user friendly! </p>

              <h2>Interviews:</h2>
              <p>I messaged some people who just vaguely said the design was "bad" to have them reiterate and
                elaborate why they thought so, and sadly only two people replied to me. But thats okay! As this is a personal project,
                I was determined to work with what I was given and stem from that! Here are some screenshots of my interviews:</p>

          <div class="analysis">
            <h1>Analysis:</h1>
            <p>After searching through posts and interviewing a few people, some of the points I will consider in my redesign are:</p>
            <li>A way to go through the artists' post faster and more conveniently</li>
            <li>When a user opens the app, it will open to the BTS Weverse (or whatever Weverse they are subscribed to or frequent the most)</li>
            <li>Currently the "BTS moments" are on both the Fan Feed and the Artist Feed page, it would be better for it to be in only one section</li>
            <li>The way the Artist's feed is structured is confusing</li>
            <li>The profile page is "plain"</li>
            <li>A way to reply to other users</li>
            <li>Improve on the way we can direct our message to a certain member in BTS or BTS all together</li>

              <h1>Ideation and Iteration:</h1>
              <p>Before I began to prototype, I made a few sketches and flows of how my final redesign would look like.
              This way I could erase and edit and get an idea of how things would looke before I started prototyping with Figma.</p>

             <div class="finalgrid1">
               <div class="landing">
                 <h2>Landing Page</h2>
                 <p>Ideally, <strong>the landing page would be the Weverse that the user is subscribed to,</strong> in my case it would be BTS.
                   If users are subscribed to more than one, it would open to the one that they frequent the most.
                    To change the Weverse they can press on the little down arrow next to the group name.
                    To make each page less cluttered, I have separated the "Weverse" page into <strong>two sections</strong>, the
                    <strong>Fan Feed</strong> and <strong>Artist Feed</strong>.</p>
               </div>

                 <img src="001.gif" alt="Gif 1 " style="height:550px;width:auto; ">
               </div>

               <div class="media">
                 <p>Fans have the option to buy Media content but the main purpose of this app is to interact with the Artist and other fans,
                   therefore I made the decision to <strong>move the Media page</strong>. It can be accessed when pressing the menu button.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="mediagif">

                 <h2>Army Membership Only</h2>
                 <p>Following the fan/artist interaction dominant scheme, I have also moved the <strong>"Army Membership"</strong> to a different location.
                   By clicking on the button, users will be able to access their membership card and any exclusive content.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   For the users who do not have the membership purchased, information about the membership will be shown
                     and if they decide to buy it, they will be prompted to buy it on the Weply app.
                 </p>

               <div class="post">
                 <h2>Creating a Post</h2>
                 <p style="font-size:18px;">One really neat thing about Weverse is the ability to direct our message to a certain member in BTS or BTS as a whole! The way to do that is to include a specific hashtag. <br>
                 <br>
                 Now, users can press the "To:" button if they want to <strong>direct their post to a member</strong>. All they have to do is click on who they want to direct their message to and the hashtag will
                 automatically be typed out for them so they don't have to remember it.<br>
                 <br>
                 I have also added little logos to both the "Hide from Artist" option and addressing "To" an option as a visual aid and better understanding.</p>

                 <h2>Artist's Moments</h2>
                 <p>Originally, Artist's Moments can be found in <strong>both</strong> the Fan Feed Page
                   and Artist Feed Page. Many users along with myself found that the repetition is pointless.<br>
                   <br>
                   Some users have also said that the moments on the fan page, the ones that had a small preview
                   of the picture before you click on it was "ugly".<br>
                   <br>
                   Now, the <strong>Artist's Moments can be found on the Fan Feed page</strong> The green rim around a member's picture
                   signifies that a new moment has been shared and users can click on it to view.</p>

                 <h2>Artist Page</h2>
                 <p style="font-size:18px; ">Similar to the Fan Feed page, I have reformatted the Artist Feed to look just like the Fan Feed.
                   It is no longer one long thread of posts, which can cause confusion that the members are just replying to one another.
                   Instead, the <strong>Artist Feed posts are separated</strong>.<br>
                   <br>
                   Users can <strong>click on envelope to access the "To Artist" page</strong>. Then they can also click on the announcement to read the
                   instructions on how to leave a post to a specific member.<br>
                   <br>
                   There is a separate envelope for each member and BTS as a whole. I redesigned it to be like this so that <strong>members can find
                    posts directed to them easier and faster!</strong> (the users as well)</p>

                 <h2>Profile Page</h2>
                 <p>I have mirrored the Profile Page to look like the Weverse Page.<br>
                 <br>
                 The <strong>Profile Page is now separated into two sections</strong>, the user's posts and comments.<br>
                 <br>
                 The little heart "Army Membership" logo will appear depending on whether or not the user has purchased the membership or not.</p>

                 <p>Users can now <strong>choose their Profile picture</strong> from the designs that Weverse offers.<br>
                 <br>
                 Since the Profile Page is now designed to be user posts and comments dominated,
                 <strong>Bookmarks and Purchases have been moved</strong> and can be found when clicking the menu button.</p>

                 <h2>Comments & Replies</h2>
                 <p>One flaw that many users seem to come to a consensus on,
                   is not being able to reply to other users. Weverse allows users to comment on posts but not reply directly to others.<br>
                   <br>
                 What if I wanted to thank someone for leaving a compliment on my posts? Well, I can't.<br>
                <br>
                 But! Now, I have implemented a reply button so that <strong>users can reply to others</strong>. This feature will spark more of a conversation
                 between which will also bring the community closer together.</p>

                  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                  <p>This short personal project was a great way for me to learn about design tools and the design process while having fun at the same time! As someone who just switched their major,
                    this was new territory for me and I always believe that I learn best by doing.
                    <br>
                    The next steps for me is to continue studying hard in school to learn more about the design thinking process and how to improve from here on out. Next steps for this project would
                    be to actually do some real extensive user testing and analyze data from there to create and even better redesign. </p>
